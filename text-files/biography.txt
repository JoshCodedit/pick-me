Since I was a kid and discovered a glitch in the game Pokemon Red that allowed me to duplicate a chosen item, I have been fascinated with how games and programmes worked and how bugs in code can cause strange things like this to happen. Having always had a creative nack I decided to put my love for problem solving and curiosity into a career in audio engineering. Feeling like I took this career as far as I could, I seeked a change and development felt like a natural transition. 

For the past year I have obsessed over the idea of becoming a developer. From waking up at 4am to study for a few hours before work, to finally going part time so that I could spend more time learning. This journey has shown me what it’s like to truly want something and are willing to make necessary sacrifices to achieve it.

My professional experience would make a great fit for any company, but my genuine love for coding and learning different technologies is what I believe truly makes me a desirable candidate for this programme.
